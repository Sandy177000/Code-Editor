# Introduction
The Code Editor project is a web-based application that allows users to edit and write HTML code in a convenient and user-friendly environment. It is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a responsive and interactive experience.

# Technical Implementation:
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used for structuring the code editor interface and defining the preview section. CSS is employed to style the interface and enhance the visual appeal. 
To achieve the live preview functionality, JavaScript is used to dynamically update the preview section whenever changes are made to the HTML code.
